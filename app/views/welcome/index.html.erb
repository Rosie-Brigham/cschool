  <section class="about">
    After graduating with a History of Art degree Rosie joined the first coRosie934hort of CodeFirst: Girls as a self-proclaimed technophobe with no programming experience. She was soon hooked and now, just over a year on, works as a full stack developer with Wool and The Gang; an ethical fashion knitwear brand. She uses her unusual background to draw on similarities between the creative arts and programming, demonstrating that you donâ€™t necessarily need a comp sci degree to build a website.

    She has spoken about her bizarre career path at Apple, Digital Shoreditch, and here she is at stack overflow.
